* Scheduler which:

+ Can track long-term tasks, like "lose 10 pounds" through periodic reminder tasks
+ Can track recurring tasks, like "deep clean every two weeks"
+ Can track one-off tasks/events due at certain times, like:
  + Do your taxes
  + Go on a hike
  + Return your library book
+ Can recognize that if you miss an event:
  + You can just skip it (like if you miss cleaning your room, it's fine)
  + You can't just skip it (like if you miss returning your books)

* Tasks need to know:

+ Effort Points/Time
+ "I will do this on this date" date
+ "I must do this by this date" date
+ "If I miss this task, do I need to still pay attention to it?" boolean

* How do we want to handle long-term/recurring tasks?

We could have two distinct "types" of tasks:
+ Single Task
+ Recurring Task
  + Creates "Single Task" items on a schedule
  + Can have an end date, but can also be infinite

* The UI
Needs to communicate:
+ What to do today
+ Any alerts

^ Overdue Tasks [x/y]
  [ ] Overdue One
^ Things To Do Today [n/m]
  [ ] Today Thing One
  [ ] Today Thing Two
^ Unassigned Tasks [t]
  Task One
  Task Two

CREATE TASK BUTTON

We will of course want a calendar view at some point so we can look at the history of tasks.
